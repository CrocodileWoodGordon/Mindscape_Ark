# Progress Log

## Completed
- Recreated a clean project scaffold with `src/core`, `systems`, `maps`, `assets`, and a smoke test harness.
- Implemented the start menu with layered title rendering, bundled font resolution, and bilingual presentation.
- Added the glitch boot, mosaic reveal, and guided cutscene that tutorials movement, combat, auto-pathing, interaction, reload, and input-method reminders.
- Built the Dormitory (Floor 50) loop: regenerated collision from `Floor50_mask.png`, staged quests, frame-triggered combat, terminal log gating, and elevator unlock toward Floor 40.
- Finished player navigation: WASD movement with conflict locks, right-click A* pathfinding with nearest-cell fallback, click feedback, and centered minimap tracking.
- Delivered the combat system: bullet spawning, cooldown/reload, HP HUD, enemy spawn heuristics, chase AI, aggro boundaries, melee attacks, telegraphed FX, death fades, and enemy health bars.
- Added the interaction layer: F prompts, dialog overlay with timer, terminal/frame messaging, NPC state handling, and elevator locks bound to quest stages.
- Developed the Sensory Lab (Floor 40): abstract collision rendering, trap cycles, energy barriers, fight/bypass branching logic, NPC state machine, branch-tailored enemy spawns, quest progression, and switch-controlled elevator unlock.
- Polished UI/feedback: quest HUD, minimap, health/ammo/reload display, player hit flash, and debug coordinate readout.
- Hardened the resource pipeline: NotoSansSC font preference, optional `boot_glitch.wav`, walk-cycle animation, and map loader improvements.
- Constructed the Memory Archive (Floor 35): maze collision + map image, ambient anomaly spawns, multi-phase boss encounter, flashback sequence, and elevator/log gating into Floor 30.
- Engineered the Logic Core (Floor 30): relay-sequencing puzzle, UI glitch vignette, failure feedback damage, weapon cache reward, ethics log gating, and elevator unlock toward Floor 25.
- Implemented an ESC-driven pause menu overlay with selectable options, plus exit-to-desktop and return-to-title wiring.

## In Progress
- Pause menu options for save/achievements are stubbed and awaiting full implementations.
- Save system hooks are reserved via `data/saves` but persistence is not wired up.

## Next Up
- Outline the Pathos Resonator (Floor 25) emotional trials and encounter flow.
- Extend the combat sandbox with additional weapons, achievements, and enemy archetypes.
- Broaden audio/visual polish and run performance profiling before scaling to deeper floors.
